Your VM should have the following apps available in the task bar:

You will now install the developer tools and samples needed to complete the scenarios.  

## 1. Clone the repository

``` git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Build25-LAB370.git ```

Then authenticate by logging in to GitHub.

## 2. Install the VSIX and Code Generation Nuget Package
These tools will be used in the first scenario to make action developement easier. 

- Navigate to the [latest Release for this repository](https://github.com/microsoft/Build25-LAB370/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and download **Lab370DevTools.zip** from the Assets.
- Extract the **Lab370DevTools** file

- Copy the Nuget package **Microsoft.AI.Actions.Annotations.0.1.0.nupkg** to your `C:\LocalNuget folder`.


## 3. Install App Actions Testing Playground 
This test tool will be used in the first scenario so you can test the actions you create.

- Navigate to the [latest Release for this repository](https://github.com/microsoft/Build25-LAB370/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and download **Microsoft.ActionsTestingTool.zip** from the Assets.
