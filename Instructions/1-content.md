# App Actions on Windows Lab Instructions
Are you looking to make features of your app more discoverable or keep users engaged in your app longer? Did you attend the App Actions on Windows session and are excited to learn more? 

You've come to the right lab! In this lab we will learn how to build and consume actions in a WinUI app from start to finish. This lab is hands on and will take forty-five minutes to one hour to complete. Below are the scenarios you will be working through:

- The first scenario will walk you through building App Actions. You will start by understanding what code needs to be added to a ToDo list app to build actions. You will then create an action from scratch in a new packaged WinUI 3 app. For both samples you will then walk through deploying the action you created, and testing it using the App Actions Testing Playground.
  
- The second scenario will walk you through taking a sample app and updating it to start consuming actions. You will then see how the action you created in the first scenario can be consumed by the sample app and will then have time to play with filtering and sorting of what actions appear in the sample app. 

The project solutions are broken up into two folders. One for each scenario.

## A quick overview of App Actions

**What is an App Action?**

 A unit of functionality offered by your app. It can be applied to user data e.g. photos, files, text and more.

**Why build App Actions?** 

When you expose your app functionality to Windows as an action, users find and invoke your actions anywhere on Windows wherever they are working, keeping them in flow. This creates better discoverability opportunities for your features and leads to more engagement with your app.
