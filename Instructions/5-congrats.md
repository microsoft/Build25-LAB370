# Congratulations! 
In this lab, you learned how to build and consume actions using the test tool, VSIX, and source code generation tools. You explored how an existing project can be updated to produce actions and how existing projects can become consumers of actions. 

Feel free to spend the remaining time asking questions to the speakers or proctors, or playing with building or consuming actions on your own!

## Recap of Main Concepts 
- **App Actions on Windows Framework**: You used this framework to register, build, and consume actions. 
- **App Actions Testing Playground**: You leveraged the test tool to test the actions you created and validate that your actions were registered and invoked correctly. 
- **App Actions on Windows Source Generation**: You leveraged the VSIX and code generation tools to make creating actions easier with less code needing to be written by you. 

## Completed Tasks 
- Set up the development environment.
- Created a text based action.
- Created another action of your choosing.
- Defined a where clause.
- Updated an app to consume actions.
- Deployed and tested actions using the test tool.
